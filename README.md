## Project 4
### [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://tjaysteno.github.io/P04-tac-tac-toe/ "See it now")

My job for this project was to write the code to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. I was provided with the HTML and CSS for three screens: one for name input, one for the game, and one victory screen. With those, I wrote code to allow a user to play the game vs a friend or my AI. I take name(s) for 1 or 2 users, display those during the game, and on the victory screen to congratulate the winner by name. While it wasn't needed to pass, I was able to create an unbeatable AI; something I had been wanting to do for a while.

__Grade:__ Exceeds Expectations

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "Amazing job on this project! Everything is clean and well put together, it's really good.

"I'm happy to see you went the extra mile to make an unbeatable AI.

"If you really wanted to step up your game in the future. Try having a second "Beatable" AI. they randomize which one you play against. Giving the user a chance to win every once and a while is great for a positive user experience.

"Keep up the amazing work!""
