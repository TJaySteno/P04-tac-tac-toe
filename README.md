## Project 4
### Tic Tac Toe

For this project, I have been given html templates and style sheets for 90% of the project. My job is to, using JavaScript, bring up the start screen with name inputs. My program will then let two people to play vs each other. Once the app registers a victory, I will have the victory screen loaded to congratulate the winner by name. This last screen will prompt them to play again, beginning the cycle anew. Finally, once all of that is complete, I will create a program that cannot be beaten.

*__Skills:__ Object Oriented JS, 'this', array iteration, callback functions*
